We develop a computational agent-based model to study cancer immune dynamics in a spatially structured environment. In this framework, individual tumor and immune cells are modeled as discrete agents that move, divide, die, and interact locally over time.
    
Immune cells can recognize and kill nearby tumor cells. The model also includes periodic immune cell injections to simulate immunotherapy. By incorporating spatial heterogeneity and local interactions, the model allows exploration of how treatment timing and immune influx influence tumor progression. This model enables exploration of tumor–immune interactions and the potential effects of immune cell–based therapies.
